This app is a memory game using React.js. This project is to test my knowlodge of React hooks.

I have used useState to store app. state values like best score, current score, card data and cards which been clicked. 
useEffect was used to run shuffle function which randomises card whenever the score changes.

This memory card game is played by clicking on a card once and then records a current score and best.

The best score is the number times you have clicked on different cards( not the same cards ) throughout the game.

The current score records you new score on different cards you have clicked.
